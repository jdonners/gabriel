Version 1.3.1: Bugfix (1 Nov 2016)

 * Fixed name change for distribution of halo exchanges (now it's again call dist%halo..)

Version 1.3: Ready for more (25 Oct 2016)

 * Derived type decomposition now replaced with types composition and distribution.
 * Renamed derived type halo to parcel.

Version 1.2: Reduce the overhead! (10 Dec 2015)

 * Added functions to disable and enable checking of array bounds (default is enabled): gabriel_disable_checking, gabriel_enable_checking, gabriel_set_checking

Version 1.1: Bugfix release (27 Oct 2015)

 * Bug fixed when no periodicity is required.

Version 1.0: Initial release (23 Oct 2015)

 * This library provides convenience functions for Fortran codes using MPI to do computations on regular grids. It simplifies the implementation of halo exchanges and transformations to only two routines: one to setup and one to transfer data.
